Question 01
--------------
Using Command Prompt on a Windows system, write the exact commands to complete the
following tasks:
. Create New directories named CSC2244, Marks and Exam on your Desktop.
. Inside the CSC2244 directory, create three subdirectories named practical, theory, and exam
papers.
. Inside each subdirectories, create a text file, a Word document, and a PowerPoint document
respectively:
Ex
Practical -+Word document, PowerPoint document, text file
. Create two new excel files in desktop named Icae.Marks and Final.Exan Marks and move that files
into the directory Marks
. Copy the Directory Marks into the Exam directory and hide the Exam directory

Answer:

mkdir CSC2244
cd CSC2244

mkdir practical 
cd practical
echo. > practical.txt
echo. > practical.docx
echo. > practical.pptx
cd..

mkdir theory 
cd theory
echo. > theory.txt
echo. > theory.docx
echo. > theory.pptx
cd..

mkdir "exam papers"
cd exam_papers
echo. > exam_papers.txt
echo. > exam_papers.docx
echo. > exam_papers.pptx
cd..

mkdir Marks 
mkdir Exam


:: Move Excel files to the Marks directory
move "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Icae Marks.xlsx" "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Marks"
move "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Final Exam Marks.xlsx" "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Marks"

:: Copy Marks directory into Exam and hide Exam
xcopy "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Marks" "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Exam\Marks" /E /I
attrib +h "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Exam"

Question 02
------------


1.Filter the rows where the GPA greater than 3.5
code:
awk -F, 'NR==1 || $4>3.5' data.csv

output:
ID,Name,Major,GPA
2,Jane Smith,Mathematics,3.8
3,Mark Taylor,Engineering,3.6
5,Michael Brown,Chemistry,3.9
6,Jessica Wilson,Physics,3.7

Explanation:
'NR==1 || $4>3.5': 
NR is the "Number of Record," meaning the current line number in the input file.
NR==1 means "if this is the first line" (typically the header line).
So, this part says: always print the first line (header row).
$4>3.5
$4 means "the value of the 4th field (column)" in the current line.
This checks if the 4th field (GPA) is greater than 3.5.



2.Calculate the average GPA of all students
code:
--------
awk -F, 'NR>1 {sum+=$4; count++} END {if(count>0) print "Average GPA:", sum/count}' data.csv

output:
--------
Average GPA: 3.55

Explanation:
---------------
'NR>1 {sum+=$4; count++} END {if(count>0) print "Average GPA:", sum/count}': The awk program with two blocks:

NR>1 {sum+=$4; count++}
NR = current line number (record number).
NR>1 means this block applies to all lines except the first line (which is usually the header).
sum+=$4 means add the value in the 4th field (GPA) of the current line to the variable sum.
count++ increments the variable count by 1 â€” keeping track of how many GPAs we have added.
Essentially, this block accumulates the total GPA and counts the number of students.

END {if(count>0) print "Average GPA:", sum/count}
The END block runs after processing all input lines.
It checks if count is greater than 0 (to avoid division by zero).

Question 03
----------------

1. Read two Strings from user String_1 and String.2
2. Count the characters of each String and print the lengthy String as shown in the Expected output

code:

# Read two strings from the user
read -p "Enter String_1: " str1
read -p "Enter String_2: " str2

# Get the length of both strings
len1=${#str1}
len2=${#str2}

# Compare the lengths and print the larger string
if [ $len1 -gt $len2 ]; then
    echo "$str1 is larger than $str2"
elif [ $len2 -gt $len1 ]; then
    echo "$str2 is larger than $str1"
else
    echo "Both strings are of equal length"
fi

 
Expected output :

Enter String_1
Apple
Enter String_2
Banana
Banana is larger than Apple
